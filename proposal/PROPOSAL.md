# Project Proposal – Checkpoint 1

## Problem Statement & Why It Matters

Chamber music ensembles often face a significant hurdle when wanting to perform pieces that only exist for a single melodic instrument (e.g., a solo violin part), lacking complementary parts for the rest of the ensemble (e.g., cello, viola, second violin). This limitation restricts repertoire choices for groups, prevents musicians of varying skill levels or instruments from participating in jam sessions due to a lack of chords or sheet music, and poses a barrier for beginners seeking to play desired pieces for which arrangements or chords are unavailable. Paired with a lack of a robust and user-friendly interface, we seek to leverage AI that can creatively generate harmonies and music sheets for other instruments so musicians across different disciplines can collaborate and play.

## Existing Tools and Their Problems

### Multi-Track Music Machine (MMM)
- **What it does:** MMM uses AI to make music for several instruments at the same time, starting from a melody and adding harmonies.
- **Problems:**
  - Only a few controls, so you can’t really shape the music the way you want.
  - The results often feel random or don’t match what the user is hoping for.
  - It’s hard to use for specific group needs or styles.
  - Audio quality is subpar and requires heavy computation use, thus making it less efficient for music generation.

### Magenta Studio
- **What it does:** Magenta Studio is a set of AI tools that work inside music programs like Ableton Live. It helps create new melodies, chords, and drum parts.
- **Problems:**
  - Very limited controls, making it tough to change details in the music.
  - The music often sounds robotic or doesn’t have much emotion.
  - It’s not designed for making special arrangements for your own group.
  - Crashes and freezes while loading or saving projects in Magenta Studio.

### Suno
- **What it does:** Suno is an AI that can make full songs from just a text description, handling music and sometimes lyrics in different languages.
- **Problems:**
  - Music often sounds generic or lacks a truly human touch.
  - The output is hard to separate or edit for use by real musicians in a group.
  - There are copyright and fairness concerns because of how Suno uses existing music data.
  - Can be used to generate inappropriate and harmful content.

## What’s Missing from Current Tools

1. **Not Enough User Control:** Most tools don’t let you pick the instruments, style, or how hard the music is, so it’s difficult to get exactly what you want.
2. **Music Lacks Feeling:** AI-generated music often doesn’t sound expressive or emotional, which makes it less enjoyable to play or listen to.
3. **Hard to Use for Groups:** It’s difficult to break up the music into parts or make it editable for group rehearsals or performances.
4. **Too Many Choices, Not Enough Help:** Beginners can get overwhelmed by all the options, but there’s no clear way to choose what’s best.
5. **Legal and Ownership Issues:** It’s unclear who owns music created by AI, especially when the AI is trained on copyrighted songs.

## Methods – Responsible AI Use Statement

I used Perplexity Browser Assitant recent model (Perplexity Sonar) on September 18, 2025 to synthesize and paraphrase information to generate a proposal for our project idea. This includes summarizing the problem statement, features, and tools. All AI generated content was critically reviewed and edited for quality assurance by a human author. 

### Exact Prompts Used

Here are the exact prompts I used:

1.  
> For checkpoint one help me write problem and importance and prior systems and gaps (cited). Look at this github repo for context: [https://github.com/SALT-Lab-Human-AI/project-check-point-1-music](https://github.com/SALT-Lab-Human-AI/project-check-point-1-music)

2.  
> Paraphrase it for simpler language

3.  
> For other tools, break it down by tool do not group it all together, only choose two tools

4.  
> Include Suno as well

5.  
> Now show me update proposal

6.  
> Read these guidelines and follow them:  
‼️Responsible Use and Disclosure of AI Tools in Academic Writing ... [summarized content] ... Transparency and accountability are non-negotiable. Disclose, label, and take full responsibility for all AI use in your work ... References: (list of reference links)

7.  
> format it in md

8.  
> Remove figure 1

9.  
> Read this and cite accordingly: [https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-AI-tools](https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-AI-tools)

10.  
> Include exact prompts that were used
