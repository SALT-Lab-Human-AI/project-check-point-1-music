**Summary:**
This paper talks about how music creators experience AI being used in their creative process. The authors identify a tension between excitement and AI's potential. Sometimes it can speeden up workflows while sometimes it offers inspiration but there is a lack of knowledge about authorship as well. Ethics come in between the boundaries artists have to go through. Some qualitative interviews argue that AI is only used for creativity while others talk about how it dilutes authorship or biases. Artists should be aware of these designs to balance efficency with realism. 

**3 Insights:**
AI is often framed as a collaborator rather than just a tool while keeping in realization of the ethics. Muscians are able to co-create to mitigate and retain agency while developing good art. 

Ethical concerns are central — ownership, attribution, and creative credit remain deeply important to practitioners. All of these limitations are extremely important to artists as they use a lot of resources and time to create art. Ethics are always taken in consideration. 

Some artists prefer transparency rather than the outcomes used by AI. Trust in AI depends on explainability and some of them just simply choose not to engage with it. 

**Limitations/Risks**
The study sample is small and may not represent the diversity of music or levels of experience. Needs more recognition.

Findings cannot capture all of the experience and behaviors with AI. AI is ever changing and many people have different use cases. 

**Ideas**
AI-driven music experience dashboard that gives users transparency into why a recommendation or generation was made; like an emotional intelligence tool.

**Summary**
Ferwerda's writing addresses the challenges of how music recommendation systems fails to align with users' personal preferences and psychological traits, leading to bad experiences. The research explores the role of personality factors in also shaping the music outcomes and recommendations. Using experiments, the author demonstrates the interface design strategies that better support exploration, discovery and trust. The discussion argues that user-centered recommendation systems can lead to deeper engagement and overall experience. 

**3 Insights**
Personality based personalization can better cater to a lot of artists. Psychological differences in music taste can also be better catered to.

Accuracy is important but users value being surpurised by exploration and newer content as well. 

User interface design is critical for how much users can enjoy a recommendation. 

**Limitation/Risks**
Personality driven systems are risky towards sterotypes and pigeonholing users. Limiting diversity and recommendations might be not aligned. 

Collecting personality and data introduces privacy and consent. Needs to be held with transparency. 

**Idea**
Integrate a “mood + personality” layer into music experiences
