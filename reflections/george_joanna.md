## Paper 1: A Review of Intelligent Music Generation Systems

**AMA Citation:**  
Wang L, Zhao Z, Liu H, Pang J, Qin Y, Wu Q. *A Review of Intelligent Music Generation Systems.* arXiv. 2023; arXiv:2211.09124. doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.09124.

### Summary
This paper surveys the latest intelligent music generation systems, covering methods from rule-based approaches to modern deep learning models, particularly focusing on symbolic (note-based) composition. It analyzes essential properties—structural awareness and interpretive control—that make music AI outputs coherent and usable for musicians. The authors discuss diverse evaluation strategies, cross-cultural system designs, and the evolution of user-centric applications, highlighting both achievements and persisting gaps in controllability and expressiveness.

### Insights Learned
- Structural coherence (long-term musical patterns) and interpretive ability (controllable interfaces) are crucial for professional and amateur adoption of music generation AI.  
- Transformer-based models are the current state-of-the-art for creating polyphonic and multitrack music with human-like structure.  
- Effective evaluation requires both computational metrics and human listening tests, connecting technical progress to artistic value.  

### Limitations / Risks
- Many systems lack fine-grained user steering, leading to musical outputs that are unpredictable or not easily tailored for group arrangements.  
- There remain benchmarking gaps and inconsistent evaluation protocols, making it difficult to systematically improve expressiveness or reliability across platforms.  

### Concrete Project Application
Our project can leverage insights from this review by emphasizing robust, interpretable controls (e.g., difficulty, instrument role, style) and developing structured evaluation combining objective metrics and user feedback—thus directly addressing unmet needs in current intelligent music generation tools, especially for customizable ensemble arrangements.

Nemade MU, Babu S, Khan S. *From Tradition to Innovation: A Review of AI Music Generation Models, Datasets, and Evaluation Techniques.* SSL+CNN. 2024. Available from: [https://spast.org/techrep/article/download/5262/537/10498](https://spast.org/techrep/article/download/5262/537/10498)

### Summary
This paper reviews how AI helps create music, focusing on models that make melodies and rhythms from computer data. It explains different AI methods from simple rules to advanced neural networks like transformers. The paper highlights the importance of training AI on a wide variety of musical examples and discusses issues of fairness and copyright. The authors emphasize that combining different AI methods can make music sound more natural and expressive.

### Insights Learned
- Using a mix of AI methods helps create music that sounds better and more interesting.  
- Training AI on diverse music examples allows it to produce more realistic and varied pieces.  
- It is important to respect artists' rights and avoid copying music unfairly.  

### Limitations / Risks
- Current AI tools often don’t give users enough control over the music they create.  
- Legal and ethical problems related to music ownership and data bias still need solving.  

### Concrete Project Application
This paper guides us to use AI models that combine strengths for better music parts, ensure our music data respects copyrights, and build a tool that musicians can easily control.
